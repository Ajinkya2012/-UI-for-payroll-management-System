Payroll calculations are the most complex function in any company. Having a consolidated system that handles most 
of the functions is proven to be most effective and efficient. It is not an easy task to have each payroll function to

data entry, calculating wages, statutory deductions, tax filing etc consume time and energy. HR can reduce the time 
invested in this repetitive task and utilize their time in value-added tasks. Therefore, having a payroll system that 
can reduce manual repetitive tasks will save both time, energy, and money for the company. 
Payroll software should maintain confidentiality, and security, be cost-effective, automated, and most importantly 
reliable. It should be adaptable and highly customizable to accommodate custom changes with new features and 
enhancements.We aim to build a custom payroll management system to reduce errors and automate the whole process. Currently, 
the system has a lot of manual tasks and consumes resources and money. We are looking to build, design and 
implement a system that can reduce HR workload by 60-70%
